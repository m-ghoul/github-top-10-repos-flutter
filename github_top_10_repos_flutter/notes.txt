To load images into your flutter project

2. Create a folder in assets called images
3. Add images inside the images folder
4. Define the path to the images folder in pubscpec.yaml as follows:

assets:
    - assets/images/filename.type

NOTE: This has to be done for every picture you use in your flutter application
5. Display the image in your app using Image.asset('asset_path_goes_here')
